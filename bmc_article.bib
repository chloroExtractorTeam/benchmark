	abstract = {Background: Chloroplast genes and genomes are the most important genomic data for plant phylogeny and DNA barcoding. Since the rapid development of high throughput sequencing technologies, it is cheap to get the low coverage data of whole genome, which is enough to assemble a complete chloroplast genome. To date, there are many assembly processes/pipelines described to assemble a complete chloroplast genome. In this study, we reported a simple and fast procedure to assemble a circular chloroplast genome using GetOrganelle pipeline.Findings: The GetOrganelle pipeline consists of four steps: 1) recruiting plastid-like reads; 2) de novo assembly using SPAdes; 3) filtering plastid-like contigs; and 4) visualizing and editing de novo assembly graph. Of them, the first three steps can be fulfilled automatically just using a combined command; and the fourth step is to visualize and evaluate the assemblies. Of 57 tested species with public datasets, we directly reassembled the circular chloroplast genome in 47 species. The eight non-circular species having break points, which may be caused by mononucleotide or dinonucleotide repeats, or small reads pool. In addition, we successfully assembled the circular chloroplast genome for the other 903 species of angiosperms using this pipeline, representing 41 families and 358 genera.Conclusion: The GetOrganelle pipeline is an effective way for land plants to assemble the circular chloroplast genome, without needs for reference-guided scaffolding, gap filling nor start-end point closing. This pipeline can be also applied to assemble mitochondrial genomes and nuclear Ribosomal DNAs using genome skimming data.},

	abstract = {The evolution in next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) technology has led to the development of many different assembly algorithms, but few of them focus on assembling the organelle genomes. These genomes are used in phylogenetic studies, food identification and are the most deposited eukaryotic genomes in {GenBank}. Producing organelle genome assembly from whole genome sequencing ({WGS}) data would be the most accurate and least laborious approach, but a tool specifically designed for this task is lacking. We developed a seed-and-extend algorithm that assembles organelle genomes from whole genome sequencing ({WGS}) data, starting from a related or distant single seed sequence. The algorithm has been tested on several new (Gonioctena intermedia and Avicennia marina) and public (Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa) whole genome Illumina data sets where it outperforms known assemblers in assembly accuracy and coverage. In our benchmark, {NOVOPlasty} assembled all tested circular genomes in less than 30 min with a maximum memory requirement of 16 {GB} and an accuracy over 99.99\%. In conclusion, {NOVOPlasty} is the sole de novo assembler that provides a fast and straightforward extraction of the extranuclear genomes from {WGS} data in one circular high quality contig.

As a result, obtaining plastid {DNA} sequence is a particularly cost-effective way of discovering genetic information about a plant. Until recently, the sequence information gathered in this way was generally limited to small portions of the genome amplified by polymerase chain reaction, but recent advances in sequencing technology have stimulated a substantial rate of increase in the sequencing of complete plastid genomes. Within the last year, the number of complete plastid genomes accessible in public sequence repositories has exceeded 1000. This sudden flood of data raises numerous challenges in data analysis and interpretation, but also offers the keys to potential insights across large swathes of plant biology. We examine what has been learnt so far, what more could be learnt if we look at the data in the right way, and what we might gain from the tens of thousands more genome sequences that will surely arrive in the next few years. The most exciting new discoveries are likely to be made at the interdisciplinary interfaces between molecular biology and ecology.},

Subsequent to the evolution of primary plastids, photosynthesis spread from red and green algae to unrelated eukaryotes by secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis. Although the movement of cyanobacterial genes from endosymbiont to host is well studied, less is known about the migration of eukaryotic genes from one nucleus to the other in the context of serial endosymbiosis. Here I explore the magnitude and potential impact of nucleus-to-nucleus endosymbiotic gene transfer in the evolution of complex algae, and the extent to which such transfers compromise our ability to infer the deep structure of the eukaryotic tree of life. In addition to endosymbiotic gene transfer, horizontal gene transfer events occurring before, during, and after endosymbioses further confound our efforts to reconstruct the ancient mergers that forged multiple lines of photosynthetic microbial eukaryotes.},

We focus on technical developments including low-cost sequence library preparation approaches for genome skimming, enrichment via hybrid baits and methylation-sensitive capture, sequence platforms with higher read outputs and longer read lengths, and automated tools for assembly. These developments allow for a much more streamlined assembly than via conventional short-range {PCR}.

* We analyzed the plastomes of several parasites with a major focus on the genus Orobanche using genome-descriptive and Bayesian phylogenetic-comparative methods. Besides this, we scanned the parasites’ other cellular genomes to trace the fate of all genes that were purged from their plastomes.


* Our analyses indicate that the first functional gene losses occurred within 10 Myr of the transition to obligate parasitism in Orobanchaceae, and that the physical plastome reduction proceeds by small deletions that accumulate over time. Evolutionary rate shifts coincide with the genomic reduction process in broomrapes, suggesting that the shift of selectional constraints away from photosynthesis to other molecular processes alters the plastid rate equilibrium. Most of the photosynthesis-related genes or fragments of genes lost from the plastomes of broomrapes have survived in their nuclear or mitochondrial genomes as the results of multiple intracellular transfers and subsequent fragmentation.


* Our findings indicate that nonessential {DNA} is eliminated much faster in the plastomes of nonphotosynthetic parasites than in their other cellular genomes.},

	abstract = {Obtaining accurate phylogenies and effective species discrimination using a small standardized set of plastid genes is challenging in evolutionarily young lineages. Complete plastid genome sequencing offers an increasingly easy-to-access source of characters that helps address this. The usefulness of this approach, however, depends on the extent to which plastid haplotypes track morphological species boundaries. We have tested the power of complete plastid genomes to discriminate among multiple accessions of 11 of 13 New Caledonian Araucaria species, an evolutionarily young lineage where the standard {DNA} barcoding approach has so far failed and phylogenetic relationships have remained elusive. Additionally, 11 nuclear gene regions were Sanger sequenced for all accessions to ascertain the success of species discrimination using a moderate number of nuclear genes. Overall, fewer than half of the New Caledonian Araucaria species with multiple accessions were monophyletic in the plastid or nuclear trees. However, the plastid data retrieved a phylogeny with a higher resolution compared to any previously published tree of this clade and supported the monophyly of about twice as many species and nodes compared to the nuclear data set. Modest gains in discrimination thus are possible, but using complete plastid genomes or a small number of nuclear genes in {DNA} barcoding may not substantially raise species discriminatory power in many evolutionarily young lineages. The big challenge therefore remains to develop techniques that allow routine access to large numbers of nuclear markers scaleable to thousands of individuals from phylogenetically disparate sample sets.},

Here, we review the data on the circular or linear form, replication, repair, and persistence of the organellar {DNA} ({orgDNA}) in plants. The bacterial origin of {orgDNA} appears to have profoundly influenced ideas about the properties of chromosomal {DNA} molecules in these organelles to the point of dismissing data inconsistent with ideas from the 1970s. When found at all, circular genome-sized molecules comprise a few percent of {orgDNA}. In cells active in {orgDNA} replication, most {orgDNA} is found as linear and branched-linear forms larger than the size of the genome, likely a consequence of a virus-like {DNA} replication mechanism. In contrast to the stable chromosomal {DNA} molecules in bacteria and the plant nucleus, the molecular integrity of {orgDNA} declines during leaf development at a rate that varies among plant species. This decline is attributed to degradation of damaged-but-not-repaired molecules, with a proposed repair cost-saving benefit most evident in grasses. All {orgDNA} maintenance activities are proposed to occur on the nucleoid tethered to organellar membranes by developmentally-regulated proteins.},

Objective evaluation of these methods is essential (i) to assure high quality, (ii) to identify strong and weak points of the algorithms, (iii) to measure the improvements introduced by new methods and (iv) to enable non-specialists to choose an appropriate tool. Here, we discuss the development of formal benchmarks, designed to represent the current problems encountered in the bioinformatics field. We consider several criteria for building good benchmarks and the advantages to be gained when they are used intelligently. To illustrate these principles, we present a more detailed discussion of benchmarks for multiple alignments of protein sequences. As in many other domains, significant progress has been achieved in the multiple alignment field and the datasets have become progressively more challenging as the existing algorithms have evolved. Finally, we propose directions for future developments that will ensure that the bioinformatics benchmarks correspond to the challenges posed by the high throughput data.},

In the face of increasing volumes of data, heuristic methods that trade software speed for mathematical completeness must be employed. We are interested in whether trade-offs between speed and accuracy are reasonable. Also, what factors are indicative of accurate software? In this work we mine published benchmarks of computational biology software, we collect data on the relative accuracy and speed of different software and then test to see what factors influence accuracy e.g. speed, author reputation, journal impact or recency. We found that author reputation, journal impact, the number of citations, software speed and age are not reliable predictors of software accuracy. This implies that useful bioinformatics software is not only the domain of famous senior researchers. In addition, we found that there exists an excess of slow and inaccurate software tools across multiple sub-disciplines of bioinformatics. Meanwhile, there are very few tools of middling accuracy and speed. We hypothesise that a strong publication bias unduly influences the publication and development of bioinformatic software tools. In other words, at present software that is not highly ranked on speed and not highly ranked on accuracy is difficult to publish due to editorial and reviewer practices. This leaves an unfortunate gap in the literature upon which future software refinements cannot be constructed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Chloroplast genomes (cp genomes) are widely used in comparative genomics, population genetics, and phylogenetic studies. Obtaining chloroplast genomes from {RNA}-Seq data seems feasible due to the almost full transcription of {cpDNA}. However, the reliability of chloroplast genomes assembled from {RNA}-Seq instead of genomic {DNA} libraries remains to be thoroughly verified. In this study, we assembled chloroplast genomes for three Erysimum (Brassicaceae) species from three {RNA}-Seq replicas and from one genomic library of each species, using a streamlined bioinformatics protocol. We compared these assembled genomes, confirming that assembled cp genomes from {RNA}-Seq data were highly similar to each other and to those from genomic libraries in terms of overall structure, size, and composition. Although post-transcriptional modifications, such as {RNA}-editing, may introduce variations in the {RNA}-seq data, the assembly of cp genomes from {RNA}-seq appeared to be reliable. Moreover, {RNA}-Seq assembly was less sensitive to sources of error such as the recovery of nuclear plastid {DNAs} ({NUPTs}). Although some precautions should be taken when producing reference genomes in non-model plants, we conclude that assembling cp genomes from {RNA}-Seq data is a fast, accurate, and reliable strategy.},

	abstract = {Chloroplast genomes have retained a core set of genes from their cyanobacterial ancestor, most of them required for the light reactions of photosynthesis or functions connected with transcription and translation. Other genes have been transferred to the nucleus or were lost in a lineage-specific manner. The genomes are distinguished by the selection of genes retained, whether or not transcripts are edited, presence/absence of introns and small repeats and their physical organization. Plants and green algae have kept fewer plastid genes than either the red algae or the chromistan algae, which obtained their plastids from red algae by secondary endosymbiosis. Photosynthetic dinoflagellates have the fewest (fewer than 20), but still grow photoautotrophically. All chloroplast genomes map as a circle, but there have been extensive rearrangements of gene order even between related species. Genome sizes vary much more than gene content, depending on the extent of gene duplication and small repeats and the size of intergenic spacers.},

	abstract = {This review bridges functional and evolutionary aspects of plastid chromosome architecture in land plants and their putative ancestors. We provide an overview on the structure and composition of the plastid genome of land plants as well as the functions of its genes in an explicit phylogenetic and evolutionary context. We will discuss the architecture of land plant plastid chromosomes, including gene content and synteny across land plants. Moreover, we will explore the functions and roles of plastid encoded genes in metabolism and their evolutionary importance regarding gene retention and conservation. We suggest that the slow mode at which the plastome typically evolves is likely to be influenced by a combination of different molecular mechanisms. These include the organization of plastid genes in operons, the usually uniparental mode of plastid inheritance, the activity of highly effective repair mechanisms as well as the rarity of plastid fusion. Nevertheless, structurally rearranged plastomes can be found in several unrelated lineages (e.g. ferns, Pinaceae, multiple angiosperm families). Rearrangements and gene losses seem to correlate with an unusual mode of plastid transmission, abundance of repeats, or a heterotrophic lifestyle (parasites or myco-heterotrophs). While only a few functional gene gains and more frequent gene losses have been inferred for land plants, the plastid Ndh complex is one example of multiple independent gene losses and will be discussed in detail. Patterns of ndh-gene loss and functional analyses indicate that these losses are usually found in plant groups with a certain degree of heterotrophy, might rendering plastid encoded Ndh1 subunits dispensable.},

Many lycophytes, most ferns, and particular lineages of seed plants have experienced extensive structural rearrangements, including inversions and modifications to the size and content of the {IR}.

	abstract = {Fagaceae is one of the largest and economically important taxa within Fagales. Considering the incongruence among inferences from plastid and nuclear genes in the previous Fagaceae phylogeny studies, we assess the performance of plastid phylogenomics in this complex family. We sequenced and assembled four complete plastid genomes (Fagus engleriana, Quercus spinosa, Quercus aquifolioides and Quercus glauca) using reference-guided assembly approach. All of the other twelve published plastid genomes in Fagaceae were retrieved for genomic analyses (including repeats, sequence divergence and codon usage) and phylogenetic inference. The genomic analyses reveal that plastid genomes in Fagaceae are conserved. Comparing the phylogenetic relationships of the key genera in Fagaceae inferred from different codon positions and gene function datasets, we found that the first two codon sites dataset recovered nearly all relationships and received high support. Thus, the result suggested that codon composition bias had great influence on Fagaceae phylogenetic inference. Our study not only provides basic understanding of Fagaceae plastid genomes, but also illuminates the effectiveness of plastid phylogenomics in resolving relationships of this intractable family.},

The elegant simplicity of establishing massive scale databases for a few barcode loci is continuing to change our understanding of species diversity patterns, and continues to enhance human abilities to distinguish among species. Capitalizing on the developments of next generation sequencing technologies and decreasing costs of genome sequencing, there is now the opportunity for the {DNA} barcoding concept to be extended to new kinds of genomic data. We illustrate the benefits and capacity to do this, and also note the constraints and barriers to overcome before it is truly scalable. We advocate a twin track approach: (i) continuation and acceleration of global efforts to build the {DNA} barcode reference library of life on earth using standard {DNA} barcodes and (ii) active development and application of extended {DNA} barcodes using genome skimming to augment the standard barcoding approach.},
