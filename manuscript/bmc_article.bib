	abstract = {Background: Chloroplast genes and genomes are the most important genomic data for plant phylogeny and DNA barcoding. Since the rapid development of high throughput sequencing technologies, it is cheap to get the low coverage data of whole genome, which is enough to assemble a complete chloroplast genome. To date, there are many assembly processes/pipelines described to assemble a complete chloroplast genome. In this study, we reported a simple and fast procedure to assemble a circular chloroplast genome using GetOrganelle pipeline.Findings: The GetOrganelle pipeline consists of four steps: 1) recruiting plastid-like reads; 2) de novo assembly using SPAdes; 3) filtering plastid-like contigs; and 4) visualizing and editing de novo assembly graph. Of them, the first three steps can be fulfilled automatically just using a combined command; and the fourth step is to visualize and evaluate the assemblies. Of 57 tested species with public datasets, we directly reassembled the circular chloroplast genome in 47 species. The eight non-circular species having break points, which may be caused by mononucleotide or dinonucleotide repeats, or small reads pool. In addition, we successfully assembled the circular chloroplast genome for the other 903 species of angiosperms using this pipeline, representing 41 families and 358 genera.Conclusion: The GetOrganelle pipeline is an effective way for land plants to assemble the circular chloroplast genome, without needs for reference-guided scaffolding, gap filling nor start-end point closing. This pipeline can be also applied to assemble mitochondrial genomes and nuclear Ribosomal DNAs using genome skimming data.},

    abstract = "{We present an in silico approach for the reconstruction of complete mitochondrial genomes of non-model organisms directly from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data—mitochondrial baiting and iterative mapping (MITObim). The method is straightforward even if only (i) distantly related mitochondrial genomes or (ii) mitochondrial barcode sequences are available as starting-reference sequences or seeds, respectively. We demonstrate the efficiency of the approach in case studies using real NGS data sets of the two monogenean ectoparasites species Gyrodactylus thymalli and Gyrodactylus derjavinoides including their respective teleost hosts European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). MITObim appeared superior to existing tools in terms of accuracy, runtime and memory requirements and fully automatically recovered mitochondrial genomes exceeding 99.5\% accuracy from total genomic DNA derived NGS data sets in \\&lt;24 h using a standard desktop computer. The approach overcomes the limitations of traditional strategies for obtaining mitochondrial genomes for species with little or no mitochondrial sequence information at hand and represents a fast and highly efficient in silico alternative to laborious conventional strategies relying on initial long-range PCR. We furthermore demonstrate the applicability of MITObim for metagenomic/pooled data sets using simulated data. MITObim is an easy to use tool even for biologists with modest bioinformatics experience. The software is made available as open source pipeline under the MIT license at https://github.com/chrishah/MITObim.}",

The SRA was established as a public repository for the next-generation sequence data and is operated by the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). INSDC partners include the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). The SRA is accessible at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra from NCBI, at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena from EBI and at http://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp from DDBJ.

abstract = {Summary The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) is a continuously updated, online database of genetic and molecular biology data for the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that provides a global research community with centralized access to data for over 30,000 Arabidopsis genes. TAIR's biocurators systematically extract, organize, and interconnect experimental data from the literature along with computational predictions, community submissions, and high throughput datasets to present a high quality and comprehensive picture of Arabidopsis gene function. TAIR provides tools for data visualization and analysis, and enables ordering of seed and DNA stocks, protein chips, and other experimental resources. TAIR actively engages with its users who contribute expertise and data that augments the work of the curatorial staff. TAIR's focus in an extensive and evolving ecosystem of online resources for plant biology is on the critically important role of extracting experimentally based research findings from the literature and making that information computationally accessible. In response to the loss of government grant funding, the TAIR team founded a nonprofit entity, Phoenix Bioinformatics, with the aim of developing sustainable funding models for biological databases, using TAIR as a test case. Phoenix has successfully transitioned TAIR to subscription-based funding while still keeping its data relatively open and accessible. genesis 53:474–485, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. This paper describes a cross-platform ultrafast comprehensive toolkit for FASTA/Q processing. SeqKit provides executable binary files for all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX, and can be directly used without any dependencies or pre-configurations. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.

Initiatives are taking place around the world to generate {DNA} barcodes for all groups of living organisms and to make these data publically available in order to help understand, conserve, and utilize the world's biodiversity. For land plants the core {DNA} barcode markers are two sections of coding regions within the chloroplast, part of the genes, {rbcL} and {matK}. In order to create high quality databases, each plant that is {DNA} barcoded needs to have a herbarium voucher that accompanies the {rbcL} and {matK} {DNA} sequences. The quality of the {DNA} sequences, the primers used, and trace files should also be accessible to users of the data. Multiple individuals should be {DNA} barcoded for each species in order to check for errors and allow for intraspecific variation. The world's herbaria provide a rich resource of already preserved and identified material and these can be used for {DNA} barcoding as well as by collecting fresh samples from the wild. These protocols describe the whole {DNA} barcoding process, from the collection of plant material from the wild or from the herbarium, how to extract and amplify the {DNA}, and how to check the quality of the data after sequencing.},

	abstract = {Methods for identifying species by using short orthologous {DNA} sequences, known as “{DNA} barcodes,” have been proposed and initiated to facilitate biodiversity studies, identify juveniles, associate sexes, and enhance forensic analyses. The cytochrome c oxidase 1 sequence, which has been found to be widely applicable in animal barcoding, is not appropriate for most species of plants because of a much slower rate of cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene evolution in higher plants than in animals. We therefore propose the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region and the plastid {trnH}-{psbA} intergenic spacer as potentially usable {DNA} regions for applying barcoding to flowering plants. The internal transcribed spacer is the most commonly sequenced locus used in plant phylogenetic investigations at the species level and shows high levels of interspecific divergence. The {trnH}-{psbA} spacer, although short (≈450-bp), is the most variable plastid region in angiosperms and is easily amplified across a broad range of land plants. Comparison of the total plastid genomes of tobacco and deadly nightshade enhanced with trials on widely divergent angiosperm taxa, including closely related species in seven plant families and a group of species sampled from a local flora encompassing 50 plant families (for a total of 99 species, 80 genera, and 53 families), suggest that the sequences in this pair of loci have the potential to discriminate among the largest number of plant species for barcoding purposes.},

	abstract = {The plastid ndh genes encode components of the thylakoid Ndh complex which purportedly acts as an electron feeding valve to adjust the redox level of the cyclic photosynthetic electron transporters. During the process of evolution from endosymbiosis to modern chloroplast, most cyanobacterial genes were lost or transferred to nucleus. Eleven ndh genes are among the 150–200 genes remaining in higher plant chloroplast {DNA}, out of some 3000 genes in the original prokaryotic Cyanobacteria in which homologues to ndh genes encode components of the respiratory Complex I and probably other complexes. The ndh genes are absent in all sequenced plastid {DNAs} of algae except for the Charophyceae and some Prasinophyceae. With the possible exclusion of some Conifers and Gnetales, the plastid {DNA} of all photosynthetic land plants contains the ndh genes, whereas they are absent in epiphytic plants that have also lost genes for the photosynthetic machinery. Therefore, the functional role of the ndh genes seems closely related to the land adaptation of photosynthesis. Transcripts of several plastid genes require C to U editing. The ndh genes concentrate about 50\% of the editing sites of angiosperm plastid transcripts. Editing sites may be remnants from an ancestor in which a number of T to C inactivating mutations took place in the ndh genes which, during evolution, are being corrected back to T. The comparison of homologous editing sites in the {mRNAs} of angiosperm ndh genes provides a tool to investigate selective and permissive environmental conditions of past evolutionary events.},

However, the causes of variations in chloroplast genome size in seed plants have only been thoroughly analyzed within small subsets of spermatophytes. In this study, we conducted the first comparative analysis on a large scale to examine the relationship between sequence characteristics and genome size in 272 seed plants based on cross-species and phylogenetic signal analysis. Our results showed that inverted repeat regions, large or small single copies, intergenic regions, and gene number can be attributed to the variations in chloroplast genome size among closely related species. However, chloroplast gene length underwent evolution affecting chloroplast genome size in seed plants irrespective of whether phylogenetic information was incorporated. Among chloroplast genes, {atpA}, {accD} and ycf1 account for 13\% of the variation in genome size, and the average Ka/Ks values of homologous pairs of the three genes are larger than 1. The relationship between chloroplast genome size and gene length might be affected by selection during the evolution of spermatophytes. The variation in chloroplast genome size may influence energy generation and ecological strategy in seed plants.},

We provide guiding questions for study design and discuss the {eDNA} metabarcoding workflow with a focus on primers and library preparation methods. We additionally discuss important criteria for consideration of bioinformatic filtering of data sets, with recommendations for increasing transparency. Finally, looking to the future, we discuss emerging applications of {eDNA} metabarcoding in ecology, conservation, invasion biology, biomonitoring, and how {eDNA} metabarcoding can empower citizen science and biodiversity education.},

Producing organelle genome assembly from whole genome sequencing ({WGS}) data would be the most accurate and least laborious approach, but a tool specifically designed for this task is lacking. We developed a seed-and-extend algorithm that assembles organelle genomes from whole genome sequencing ({WGS}) data, starting from a related or distant single seed sequence. The algorithm has been tested on several new (Gonioctena intermedia and Avicennia marina) and public (Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa) whole genome Illumina data sets where it outperforms known assemblers in assembly accuracy and coverage. In our benchmark, {NOVOPlasty} assembled all tested circular genomes in less than 30 min with a maximum memory requirement of 16 {GB} and an accuracy over 99.99\%. In conclusion, {NOVOPlasty} is the sole de novo assembler that provides a fast and straightforward extraction of the extranuclear genomes from {WGS} data in one circular high quality contig.

However, assembly of such data into high-quality, finished genome sequences remains challenging. Many genome assembly tools are available, but they differ greatly in terms of their performance (speed, scalability, hardware requirements, acceptance of newer read technologies) and in their final output (composition of assembled sequence). More importantly, it remains largely unclear how to best assess the quality of assembled genome sequences. The Assemblathon competitions are intended to assess current state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly.In Assemblathon 2, we provided a variety of sequence data to be assembled for three vertebrate species (a bird, a fish, and snake). This resulted in a total of 43 submitted assemblies from 21 participating teams. We evaluated these assemblies using a combination of optical map data, Fosmid sequences, and several statistical methods. From over 100 different metrics, we chose ten key measures by which to assess the overall quality of the assemblies.Many current genome assemblers produced useful assemblies, containing a significant representation of their genes and overall genome structure. However, the high degree of variability between the entries suggests that there is still much room for improvement in the field of genome assembly and that approaches which work well in assembling the genome of one species may not necessarily work well for another.}",

We focus on technical developments including low-cost sequence library preparation approaches for genome skimming, enrichment via hybrid baits and methylation-sensitive capture, sequence platforms with higher read outputs and longer read lengths, and automated tools for assembly. These developments allow for a much more streamlined assembly than via conventional short-range {PCR}.

* We analyzed the plastomes of several parasites with a major focus on the genus Orobanche using genome-descriptive and Bayesian phylogenetic-comparative methods. Besides this, we scanned the parasites’ other cellular genomes to trace the fate of all genes that were purged from their plastomes.


* Our analyses indicate that the first functional gene losses occurred within 10 Myr of the transition to obligate parasitism in Orobanchaceae, and that the physical plastome reduction proceeds by small deletions that accumulate over time. Evolutionary rate shifts coincide with the genomic reduction process in broomrapes, suggesting that the shift of selectional constraints away from photosynthesis to other molecular processes alters the plastid rate equilibrium. Most of the photosynthesis-related genes or fragments of genes lost from the plastomes of broomrapes have survived in their nuclear or mitochondrial genomes as the results of multiple intracellular transfers and subsequent fragmentation.


* Our findings indicate that nonessential {DNA} is eliminated much faster in the plastomes of nonphotosynthetic parasites than in their other cellular genomes.},

	abstract = {Obtaining accurate phylogenies and effective species discrimination using a small standardized set of plastid genes is challenging in evolutionarily young lineages. Complete plastid genome sequencing offers an increasingly easy-to-access source of characters that helps address this. The usefulness of this approach, however, depends on the extent to which plastid haplotypes track morphological species boundaries. We have tested the power of complete plastid genomes to discriminate among multiple accessions of 11 of 13 New Caledonian Araucaria species, an evolutionarily young lineage where the standard {DNA} barcoding approach has so far failed and phylogenetic relationships have remained elusive. Additionally, 11 nuclear gene regions were Sanger sequenced for all accessions to ascertain the success of species discrimination using a moderate number of nuclear genes. Overall, fewer than half of the New Caledonian Araucaria species with multiple accessions were monophyletic in the plastid or nuclear trees. However, the plastid data retrieved a phylogeny with a higher resolution compared to any previously published tree of this clade and supported the monophyly of about twice as many species and nodes compared to the nuclear data set. Modest gains in discrimination thus are possible, but using complete plastid genomes or a small number of nuclear genes in {DNA} barcoding may not substantially raise species discriminatory power in many evolutionarily young lineages. The big challenge therefore remains to develop techniques that allow routine access to large numbers of nuclear markers scaleable to thousands of individuals from phylogenetically disparate sample sets.},

When found at all, circular genome-sized molecules comprise a few percent of {orgDNA}. In cells active in {orgDNA} replication, most {orgDNA} is found as linear and branched-linear forms larger than the size of the genome, likely a consequence of a virus-like {DNA} replication mechanism. In contrast to the stable chromosomal {DNA} molecules in bacteria and the plant nucleus, the molecular integrity of {orgDNA} declines during leaf development at a rate that varies among plant species. This decline is attributed to degradation of damaged-but-not-repaired molecules, with a proposed repair cost-saving benefit most evident in grasses. All {orgDNA} maintenance activities are proposed to occur on the nucleoid tethered to organellar membranes by developmentally-regulated proteins.},

To illustrate these principles, we present a more detailed discussion of benchmarks for multiple alignments of protein sequences. As in many other domains, significant progress has been achieved in the multiple alignment field and the datasets have become progressively more challenging as the existing algorithms have evolved.

In the face of increasing volumes of data, heuristic methods that trade software speed for mathematical completeness must be employed. We are interested in whether trade-offs between speed and accuracy are reasonable. Also, what factors are indicative of accurate software? In this work we mine published benchmarks of computational biology software, we collect data on the relative accuracy and speed of different software and then test to see what factors influence accuracy e.g. speed, author reputation, journal impact or recency. We found that author reputation, journal impact, the number of citations, software speed and age are not reliable predictors of software accuracy. This implies that useful bioinformatics software is not only the domain of famous senior researchers. In addition, we found that there exists an excess of slow and inaccurate software tools across multiple sub-disciplines of bioinformatics. Meanwhile, there are very few tools of middling accuracy and speed. We hypothesise that a strong publication bias unduly influences the publication and development of bioinformatic software tools. In other words, at present software that is not highly ranked on speed and not highly ranked on accuracy is difficult to publish due to editorial and reviewer practices. This leaves an unfortunate gap in the literature upon which future software refinements cannot be constructed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Obtaining chloroplast genomes from {RNA}-Seq data seems feasible due to the almost full transcription of {cpDNA}. However, the reliability of chloroplast genomes assembled from {RNA}-Seq instead of genomic {DNA} libraries remains to be thoroughly verified. In this study, we assembled chloroplast genomes for three Erysimum (Brassicaceae) species from three {RNA}-Seq replicas and from one genomic library of each species, using a streamlined bioinformatics protocol. We compared these assembled genomes, confirming that assembled cp genomes from {RNA}-Seq data were highly similar to each other and to those from genomic libraries in terms of overall structure, size, and composition. Although post-transcriptional modifications, such as {RNA}-editing, may introduce variations in the {RNA}-seq data, the assembly of cp genomes from {RNA}-seq appeared to be reliable. Moreover, {RNA}-Seq assembly was less sensitive to sources of error such as the recovery of nuclear plastid {DNAs} ({NUPTs}). Although some precautions should be taken when producing reference genomes in non-model plants, we conclude that assembling cp genomes from {RNA}-Seq data is a fast, accurate, and reliable strategy.},

We provide an overview on the structure and composition of the plastid genome of land plants as well as the functions of its genes in an explicit phylogenetic and evolutionary context. We will discuss the architecture of land plant plastid chromosomes, including gene content and synteny across land plants. Moreover, we will explore the functions and roles of plastid encoded genes in metabolism and their evolutionary importance regarding gene retention and conservation. We suggest that the slow mode at which the plastome typically evolves is likely to be influenced by a combination of different molecular mechanisms. These include the organization of plastid genes in operons, the usually uniparental mode of plastid inheritance, the activity of highly effective repair mechanisms as well as the rarity of plastid fusion. Nevertheless, structurally rearranged plastomes can be found in several unrelated lineages (e.g. ferns, Pinaceae, multiple angiosperm families). Rearrangements and gene losses seem to correlate with an unusual mode of plastid transmission, abundance of repeats, or a heterotrophic lifestyle (parasites or myco-heterotrophs). While only a few functional gene gains and more frequent gene losses have been inferred for land plants, the plastid Ndh complex is one example of multiple independent gene losses and will be discussed in detail. Patterns of ndh-gene loss and functional analyses indicate that these losses are usually found in plant groups with a certain degree of heterotrophy, might rendering plastid encoded Ndh1 subunits dispensable.},

All of the other twelve published plastid genomes in Fagaceae were retrieved for genomic analyses (including repeats, sequence divergence and codon usage) and phylogenetic inference. The genomic analyses reveal that plastid genomes in Fagaceae are conserved. Comparing the phylogenetic relationships of the key genera in Fagaceae inferred from different codon positions and gene function datasets, we found that the first two codon sites dataset recovered nearly all relationships and received high support.

	abstract = {Chloroplasts contain their own autonomously replicating {DNA} genome. The majority of proteins present in the chloroplasts are encoded by nuclear {DNA}, but the rest are encoded by chloroplast {DNA} and synthesized by the chloroplast transcription–translation machinery1–4. Although the nucleotide sequences of many chloroplast genes from various plant species have been determined, the entire gene organization of the chloroplast genome has not yet been elucidated for any species of plants. To improve our understanding of the chloroplast gene system, we have determined the complete sequence of the chloroplast {DNA} from a liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha, and deduced the gene organization. As reported here the liverwort chloroplast {DNA} contains 121,024 base pairs (bp), consisting of a set of large inverted repeats ({IRA} and {IRB}, each of 10,058 bp) separated by a small single-copy region ({SSC}, 19,813 bp) and a large single-copy region ({LSC}, 81,095 bp). We detected 128 possible genes throughout the liverwort chloroplast genome, including coding sequences for four kinds of ribosomal {RNAs}, 32 species of transfer {RNAs} and 55 identified open reading frames ({ORFs}) for proteins, which are separated by short A+T-rich spacers (Fig. 1). Twenty genes (8 encoding {tRNAs}, 12 encoding proteins) contain introns in their coding sequences. These introns can be classified as belonging to either group I or group {II}, as described for mitochondria5. Interestingly, seven of the identified {ORFs} show high homology to unidentified reading frames ({URFs}) found in human mitochondria6,7.},

	abstract = {Chloroplasts were once free-living cyanobacteria that became endosymbionts, but the genomes of contemporary plastids encode only ≈5–10\% as many genes as those of their free-living cousins, indicating that many genes were either lost from plastids or transferred to the nucleus during the course of plant evolution. Previous estimates have suggested that between 800 and perhaps as many as 2,000 genes in the Arabidopsis genome might come from cyanobacteria, but genome-wide phylogenetic surveys that could provide direct estimates of this number are lacking. We compared 24,990 proteins encoded in the Arabidopsis genome to the proteins from three cyanobacterial genomes, 16 other prokaryotic reference genomes, and yeast. Of 9,368 Arabidopsis proteins sufficiently conserved for primary sequence comparison, 866 detected homologues only among cyanobacteria and 834 other branched with cyanobacterial homologues in phylogenetic trees. Extrapolating from these conserved proteins to the whole genome, the data suggest that ≈4,500 of Arabidopsis protein-coding genes (≈18\% of the total) were acquired from the cyanobacterial ancestor of plastids. These proteins encompass all functional classes, and the majority of them are targeted to cell compartments other than the chloroplast. Analysis of 15 sequenced chloroplast genomes revealed 117 nuclear-encoded proteins that are also still present in at least one chloroplast genome. A phylogeny of chloroplast genomes inferred from 41 proteins and 8,303 amino acids sites indicates that at least two independent secondary endosymbiotic events have occurred involving red algae and that amino acid composition bias in chloroplast proteins strongly affects plastid genome phylogeny.},

Pollen shed from 235 plant species (including about 50 of agronomic importance) representing 80 families were screened. Putative plastid DNA was detected in the generative and/or sperm cells of pollen from 26 genera (43 species) representing 15 families. Plastid DNA was not detected in the generative or sperm cells of pollen from 192 plant species, thereby strongly suggesting that these species have only maternal inheritance. Our cytological diagnosis corroborated the known genetic evidence in 42 plant species and conflicted with the genetic reports in five species, which are discussed. The data suggest that biparental inheritance of plastids is rare; overall, it may occur in about 14% of flowering plant genera, examples of which are scattered among 19% of the families examined. This methodology also readily reveals whether pollen is bi- or trinucleate.},

	abstract = {Plastid genomes (plastomes) vary enormously in size and gene content among the many lineages of nonphotosynthetic plants, but key lineages remain unexplored. We therefore investigated plastome sequence and expression in the holoparasitic and morphologically bizarre Balanophoraceae. The two Balanophora plastomes examined are remarkable, exhibiting features rarely if ever seen before in plastomes or in any other genomes. At 15.5 kb in size and with only 19 genes, they are among the most reduced plastomes known. They have no {tRNA} genes for protein synthesis, a trait found in only three other plastid lineages, and thus Balanophora plastids must import all {tRNAs} needed for translation. Balanophora plastomes are exceptionally compact, with numerous overlapping genes, highly reduced spacers, loss of all cis-spliced introns, and shrunken protein genes. With A+T contents of 87.8\% and 88.4\%, the Balanophora genomes are the most {AT}-rich genomes known save for a single mitochondrial genome that is merely bloated with {AT}-rich spacer {DNA}. Most plastid protein genes in Balanophora consist of ≥90\% {AT}, with several between 95\% and 98\% {AT}, resulting in the most biased codon usage in any genome described to date. A potential consequence of its radical compositional evolution is the novel genetic code used by Balanophora plastids, in which {TAG} has been reassigned from stop to tryptophan. Despite its many exceptional properties, the Balanophora plastome must be functional because all examined genes are transcribed, its only intron is correctly trans-spliced, and its protein genes, although highly divergent, are evolving under various degrees of selective constraint.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Chloroplasts are organelles that conduct photosynthesis in plant and algal cells. The information chloroplast genome contained is widely used in agriculture and studies of evolution and ecology. Correctly assembling chloroplast genomes can be challenging because the chloroplast genome contains a pair of long inverted repeats (10-30 kb). Typically, it is simply assumed that the gross structure of the chloroplast genome matches the most commonly observed structure of two single-copy regions separated by a pair of inverted repeats. The advent of long-read sequencing technologies should remove the need to make this assumption by providing sufficient information to completely span the inverted repeat regions. Yet, long-reads tend to have higher error rates than short-reads, and relatively little is known about the best way to combine long- and short-reads to obtain the most accurate chloroplast genome assemblies. Using Eucalyptus pauciflora, the snow gum, as a test case, we evaluated the effect of multiple parameters, such as different coverage of long-(Oxford nanopore) and short-(Illumina) reads, different long-read lengths, different assembly pipelines, with a view to determining the most accurate and efficient approach to chloroplast genome assembly. RESULTS: Hybrid assemblies combining at least 20x coverage of both long-reads and short-reads generated a single contig spanning the entire chloroplast genome with few or no detectable errors. Short-read-only assemblies generated three contigs (the long single copy, short single copy and inverted repeat regions) of the chloroplast genome. These contigs contained few single-base errors but tended to exclude several bases at the beginning or end of each contig. Long-read-only assemblies tended to create multiple contigs with a much higher single-base error rate. The chloroplast genome of Eucalyptus pauciflora is 159,942 bp, contains 131 genes of known function. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that very accurate assemblies of chloroplast genomes can be achieved using a combination of at least 20x coverage of long- and short-reads respectively, provided that the long-reads contain at least {\textasciitilde}5x coverage of reads longer than the inverted repeat region. We show that further increases in coverage give little or no improvement in accuracy, and that hybrid assemblies are more accurate than long-read-only or short-read-only assemblies.},

abstract = {Abstract Next-generation sequencing allows access to a large quantity of genomic data. In plants, several studies used whole chloroplast genome sequences for inferring phylogeography or phylogeny. Even though the chloroplast is a haploid organelle, NGS plastome data identified a nonnegligible number of intra-individual polymorphic SNPs. Such observations could have several causes such as sequencing errors, the presence of heteroplasmy or transfer of chloroplast sequences in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The occurrence of allelic diversity has practical important impacts on the identification of diversity, the analysis of the chloroplast data and beyond that, significant evolutionary questions. In this study, we show that the observed intra-individual polymorphism of chloroplast sequence data is probably the result of plastid DNA transferred into the mitochondrial and/or the nuclear genomes. We further assess nine different bioinformatics pipelines’ error rates for SNP and genotypes calling using SNPs identified in Sanger sequencing. Specific pipelines are adequate to deal with this issue, optimizing both specificity and sensitivity. Our results will allow a proper use of whole chloroplast NGS sequence and will allow a better handling of NGS chloroplast sequence diversity.},

The heterogeneity was first observed using restriction fragment length polymorphism and then confirmed through cloning and sequencing. The analysis of the cloned fragments revealed the presence of two haplotypes: the most frequent type was found in 123 (88.5\\%) out of a total of 139 colonies screened. Partial sequences of the psbC-trnS fragment from both haplotypes revealed that the polymorphism occurs within the coding region of the psbC gene and consists of a synonymous transition. A contamination-free cross involving D uno as the male parent produced only plants characterized by the most frequent haplotype, indicating either selection bias against the rare type or more likely fixation of the frequent type in tissues leading to the formation of the male gametes. The MspI restriction profiles performed on various tissues suggest that the rarer type is absent from the histogenic layer LII and that D uno is a periclinal plastid chimera.}",

abstract={BACKGROUND: Chaos Game Representation (CGR) is an iterated function that bijectively maps discrete sequences into a continuous domain. As a result, discrete sequences can be object of statistical and topological analyses otherwise reserved to numerical systems. Characteristically, CGR coordinates of substrings sharing an L-long suffix will be located within 2-L distance of each other. In the two decades since its original proposal, CGR has been generalized beyond its original focus on genomic sequences and has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in bioinformatics. This report explores the possibility that it can be further extended to approach algorithms that rely on discrete, graph-based representations. RESULTS: The exploratory analysis described here consisted of selecting foundational string problems and refactoring them using CGR-based algorithms. We found that CGR can take the role of suffix trees and emulate sophisticated string algorithms, efficiently solving exact and approximate string matching problems such as finding all palindromes and tandem repeats, and matching with mismatches. The common feature of these problems is that they use longest common extension (LCE) queries as subtasks of their procedures, which we show to have a constant time solution with CGR. Additionally, we show that CGR can be used as a rolling hash function within the Rabin-Karp algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of biological sequences relies on algorithmic foundations facing mounting challenges, both logistic (performance) and analytical (lack of unifying mathematical framework). CGR is found to provide the latter and to promise the former: graph-based data structures for sequence analysis operations are entailed by numerical-based data structures produced by CGR maps, providing a unifying analytical framework for a diversity of pattern matching problems.},

abstract={Thanks to advances in next-generation technologies, genome sequences are now being generated at breadth (e.g. across environments) and depth (thousands of closely related strains, individuals or samples) unimaginable only a few years ago. Phylogenomics--the study of evolutionary relationships based on comparative analysis of genome-scale data--has so far been developed as industrial-scale molecular phylogenetics, proceeding in the two classical steps: multiple alignment of homologous sequences, followed by inference of a tree (or multiple trees). However, the algorithms typically employed for these steps scale poorly with number of sequences, such that for an increasing number of problems, high-quality phylogenomic analysis is (or soon will be) computationally infeasible. Moreover, next-generation data are often incomplete and error-prone, and analysis may be further complicated by genome rearrangement, gene fusion and deletion, lateral genetic transfer, and transcript variation. Here we argue that next-generation data require next-generation phylogenomics, including so-called alignment-free approaches.},
