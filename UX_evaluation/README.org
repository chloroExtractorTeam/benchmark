* Purpose
We want to evaluate the user friendliness of the different tools.
Therefore we will check the tools based on the following criteria.

* Criteria

The evaluation will be based on the following statements/questions. 
For each point, a tool can be evaluated as *GOOD*, *OK* or *BAD*.
Example:


Q: The tool is easy to install
GOOD: The tool can be installed by using a package archive, such as CRAN, docker, etc
OK: All dependencies are listed. A complete "install" script is preferred over a simple list
BAD: Dependencies are missing from the installation instructions or the tool cannot be installed at all


** List of questions 

- Is the tool easy to install?
- Is there a way to test the installation?
- Is there a tutorial on how to use the tool?
- Is there a good documentation on the parameter settings?
- Is the tool maintained (issues answered, implementation of new features)?
- Is the tool Open Source?

* Evaluation procedure
The tools will be installed in a Virtual Machine running Ubuntu 18.04 with no additional packages
installed. All further questions will be answered based on this installation.

** create base image

- using VirtualBox Version 5.2.18_Ubuntu r123745
- installing Ubuntu 18.04.2 (sha256: 22580b9f3b186cc66818e60f44c46f795d708a1ad86b9225c458413b638459c4)
- installed all updates via apt
- created a snapshot {87710da5-fb80-40e9-8a56-43ae639886b5}.vdi

* Evaluation of the tools
** GetOrganelle
- cloned the base VM
*** questions
**** Is the tool easy to install?
requirements from readme on github:
- python 3
- python libraries numpy, scipy, sympy ~pip install numpy scipy sympy~
- SPAdes (link in readme)
- Bowtie2 (link in readme)
- BLAST+ (link in readme)
- Bandage (link in readme)

installing dependencies:
- python3 is already installed
- pip has to be installed (not mentioned in readme)
- installation of modules successful
- spades installation successful (downloaded binary from their homepage and add to $PATH) Version 3.13.0 installed
- bowtie2 installation successful (downloaded binary from their sourceforge and add to $PATH) Version 2.3.5 installed
- blast+ installation successful (downloaded binary from their ftp and add to $PATH) Version 2.9.0 installed
- bandage installation successful(downloaded binary from their homepage, installed qt5-default and add to $PATH) Version 0.8.1 installed

installing GetOrganelle:
- following the description in the readme
- creating and moving to dir ~/Appilcations/bin
- git is not installed
- git clone repo
- adding executables to PATH like described in Readme

Conclusion:
Except for git and pip, everything needed to install GetOrganelle is listed. The installation seems to work.
There seems to be a minimal installation without the dependecies, as they are not needed for the main task. 
However, I want to have the full installation running. 


**** Is there a way to test the installation?
- running ~get_organelle_reads.py -h~ and  ~get_organelle_reads.py --help~ works.
- there are usage examples in the readme, but no test data is shipped
**** Is there a tutorial on how to use the tool?
There are some examples in the Readme
**** Is there a good documentation on the parameter settings?
There is an extensive description of the parameters when runnin  ~get_organelle_reads.py --help~
**** Is the tool maintained (issues answered, implementation of new features)?
Yes, there are recent commits and issues opened and closed
**** Is the tool Open Source?
Yes, GPL-3.0

*** summary
- Is the tool easy to install? OK
- Is there a way to test the installation? BAD
- Is there a tutorial on how to use the tool? OK
- Is there a good documentation on the parameter settings? GOOD
- Is the tool maintained (issues answered, implementation of new features)? GOOD
- Is the tool Open Source? GOOD

** fast-plast
cloned VM from base
*** questions
**** Is the tool easy to install?
There is a long list of dependencies on the github readme. However, the offer an
installation script. I will use this:

- install git (not mentioned in readme)
- clone repo
- running the installation perl script. It is semi automatic (had to answer 2 questions about dependency installation at the beginning)
- error while compiling something
- installed make
- delete fast-plast dir and run again -> error
- installed g++
- try again
- error
- install libz-dev
- try again
- success
- try again as a whole
- success

** org-asm
cloned base VM image 
*** questions
**** Is the tool easy to install?
following the instructions here:
https://docs.metabarcoding.org/asm/install.html

requirements:
- python 3.5 (3.6.7 is installed)
- gcc (installed version 7.3.0 via apt)

downloaded org-asm as .tar.gz from https://git.metabarcoding.org/org-asm/org-asm
https://git.metabarcoding.org/org-asm/org-asm/repository/master/archive.tar.gz

running python3 get-orgasm.py returns an error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils.errors'

installing python3-distutils via apt

-> different error, pip seems to be missing
installing python3-pip

different error, suggest to install python3-venv

got an error unexpected keyword argument 'capture_output' - according to 
Stackoverflow, this is was introduced in python 3.7 

installing python 3.7 via apt as mentioned here:
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-python-3-7-on-ubuntu-18-04/

same error... strangely the first output line is always
Unable to install ORG.asm on your system
but then it starts installing anyway...

next try: fresh VM, installed python3.7 via apt, gcc, python3-pip, python3-distutils and python3.7-venv
download the tar like above

looks better, different error

installing python3.7-dev

seems to be working, trying again with a fresh VM just to be sure.

Installation procedure:
- apt update
- add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
- apt install python3.7
- apt install gcc python3-pip python3-distutils python3.7-venv python3.7-dev
- download tar from gitlab
- extract tar and run python3.7 get-orgasm.py

It works.
