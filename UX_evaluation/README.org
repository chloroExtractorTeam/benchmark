* Purpose
We want to evaluate the user friendliness of the different tools.
Therefore we will check the tools based on the following criteria.

* Criteria

The evaluation will be based on the following statements/questions. 
For each point, a tool can be evaluated as *GOOD*, *OK* or *BAD*.
Example:


Q: The tool is easy to install
GOOD: The tool can be installed by using a package archive, such as CRAN, docker, etc
OK: All dependencies are listed. A complete "install" script is preferred over a simple list
BAD: Dependencies are missing from the installation instructions or the tool cannot be installed at all


** List of questions 

- Is the tool easy to install?
- Is there a way to test the installation?
- Is there a tutorial on how to use the tool?
- Is there a good documentation on the parameter settings?
- Is the tool maintained (issues answered, implementation of new features)?
- Is the tool Open Source?

* Evaluation procedure
The tools will be installed in a Virtual Machine running Ubuntu 18.04 with no additional packages
installed. All further questions will be answered based on this installation.

** create base image

- cloned the base VM
*** questions
**** Is the tool easy to install?
requirements from readme on github:
- python 3
- python libraries numpy, scipy, sympy ~pip install numpy scipy sympy~
- SPAdes (link in readme)
- Bowtie2 (link in readme)
- BLAST+ (link in readme)
- Bandage (link in readme)

installing dependencies:
- python3 is already installed
- pip has to be installed (not mentioned in readme)
- installation of modules successful
- spades installation successful (downloaded binary from their homepage and add to $PATH) Version 3.13.0 installed
- bowtie2 installation successful (downloaded binary from their sourceforge and add to $PATH) Version 2.3.5 installed
- blast+ installation successful (downloaded binary from their ftp and add to $PATH) Version 2.9.0 installed
- bandage installation successful(downloaded binary from their homepage, installed qt5-default and add to $PATH) Version 0.8.1 installed

installing GetOrganelle:
- following the description in the readme
- creating and moving to dir ~/Appilcations/bin
- not mentioned, that the directory has to be created first
- git is not installed
- git clone repo
- adding executables to PATH like described in Readme

Conclusion:
Except for git and pip, everything needed to install GetOrganelle is listed. The installation seems to work.
There seems to be a minimal installation without the dependecies, as they are not needed for the main task. 
However, I want to have the full installation running. 


**** Is there a way to test the installation?
- running ~get_organelle_reads.py -h~ and  ~get_organelle_reads.py --help~ works.
- there are usage examples in the readme, but no test data is shipped

I will test it using the chloroextractor test dataset
- apparently, I have to install python, too
- I get some warnings about bowtie, spades and blast not being in PATH, but they are
- seems to be running though
- ends with segmentation fault
- installed psutil via pip3 to log memory
- try again
- it finished, but I only get the reads since the dependencies are not found
**** Is there a tutorial on how to use the tool?
There are some examples in the Readme
**** Is there a good documentation on the parameter settings?
There is an extensive description of the parameters when runnin  ~get_organelle_reads.py --help~
**** Is the tool maintained (issues answered, implementation of new features)?
Yes, there are recent commits and issues opened and closed
**** Is the tool Open Source?
Yes, GPL-3.0

** fast-plast
cloned VM from base
*** questions
**** Is the tool easy to install?
There is a long list of dependencies on the github readme. However, the offer an
installation script. I will use this:

- install git (not mentioned in readme)
- clone repo
- running the installation perl script. It is semi automatic (had to answer 2 questions about dependency installation at the beginning)
- error while compiling something
- installed make
- delete fast-plast dir and run again -> error
- installed g++
- try again
- error
- install libz-dev
- try again
- success
- try again as a whole
- success

**** Is there a way to test the installation?
No - But I will try the example command from the readme with one of our simulated datasets
sim_1.150bp.1-100.2M.fq and sim_2.150bp.1-100.2M.fq

it looks like java is missing - installing default-jre and try again
dies with the message, unable to detect quality encoding - maybe an issues due to the simulated reads all having ~I~ as phred score?

I will try with the example data from chloroextractor

different error - can't locate python, installing python and try again

works.

**** Is there a tutorial on how to use the tool?
Not a real tutorial, but explanations of the parameters, input and output
**** Is there a good documentation on the parameter settings?
Yes, the documentation in the readme file looks good
**** Is the tool maintained (issues answered, implementation of new features)?
Yes
**** Is the tool Open Source?
Yes, MIT License

** org-asm
cloned base VM image 
*** questions
**** Is the tool easy to install?
following the instructions here:
https://docs.metabarcoding.org/asm/install.html

requirements:
- python 3.5 (3.6.7 is installed)
- gcc (installed version 7.3.0 via apt)

downloaded org-asm as .tar.gz from https://git.metabarcoding.org/org-asm/org-asm
https://git.metabarcoding.org/org-asm/org-asm/repository/master/archive.tar.gz

running python3 get-orgasm.py returns an error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils.errors'

installing python3-distutils via apt

-> different error, pip seems to be missing
installing python3-pip

different error, suggest to install python3-venv

got an error unexpected keyword argument 'capture_output' - according to 
Stackoverflow, this is was introduced in python 3.7 

installing python 3.7 via apt as mentioned here:
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-python-3-7-on-ubuntu-18-04/

same error... strangely the first output line is always
Unable to install ORG.asm on your system
but then it starts installing anyway...

next try: fresh VM, installed python3.7 via apt, gcc, python3-pip, python3-distutils and python3.7-venv
download the tar like above

looks better, different error

installing python3.7-dev

seems to be working, trying again with a fresh VM just to be sure.

Installation procedure:
- apt update
- add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
- apt install python3.7
- apt install gcc python3-pip python3-distutils python3.7-venv python3.7-dev
- download tar from gitlab
- extract tar and run python3.7 get-orgasm.py

It works.


**** Is there a way to test the installation?
not really, but there is a tutorial with test data, which I will use to
test the installation

markus found a way using valgrind to run it successfully. I will try that, too:

- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install valgrind
- make testrun dir in /tmp
- following the tutorial
- downloading the reads
- running oa index command with ~--no-pipe~ option
- get segfault
- run the ~orgasmi~ command from log with valgrind (~valgrind orgasmi ...~)
- no errors
- running ~oa buildgraph~ command from tutorial
- running ~oa unfold~ command from tutorial

success, I get an assembly
**** Is there a tutorial on how to use the tool?
yes
https://docs.metabarcoding.org/asm/mitochondrion.html

it is for mitochondrion and not chloroplasts, but should give an idea of how to use the software.

- downloaded datasets
- running index command
- failed with error "Cannot open file butterfly.odx/index.ogx" (file does not exist)

This error is caused by a segfault, that goes away when running it with valgrind
**** Is there a good documentation on the parameter settings?
Parameters are explained when using ~--help~
**** Is the tool maintained (issues answered, implementation of new features)?
yes, last commit is about a week ago, Frank got an answer to his email

** IOGA
*** questions
**** Is the tool easy to install?
downloaded zip from github


apparently, I need to install python first 
- apt install python python-pip 
- pip install wget

some dependency installations failed, maybe make is missing
-apt install build-essential

no difference. I still get errors saying that some dependencies fail, but no reasons for failing.
I will probably have to install them manually.
Failing:
- picard (maybe because of java missing)
- samtools
- ALE
- seqtk

installing default-jre
picard works

samtools probably misses zlib.h -> installing libz-dev
missing curses.h -> installing libncurses5-dev
samtools seems to work, ALE and seqtk, too

trying again with setup script
works.

**** Is there a way to test the installation?
they suggest to run IOGA.py -h

returns an error -> matplotlib is missing
running pip install matplotlib
no mopdule named Bio -> installing via pip install biopython

now it works

**** Is there a tutorial on how to use the tool?
no
**** Is there a good documentation on the parameter settings?
short explanation of the parameters when running ~IOGA.py -h~
**** Is the tool maintained (issues answered, implementation of new features)?
not really, no issues open, last closed in march 2018, last commit in september 2016
**** Is the tool Open Source?
No license in the github repo

** Chloroplast Assembly Protocol
*** questions
**** Is the tool easy to install?
- download zip from github
- unzip
- perl install.pl
- most are OK, one requires g++ 
- apt install g++
- try again
- apt install make
- try again
- zlib.h missing -> installing libz-dev
- try again
- preccpp.h missing -> installing libpcre3-dev
- seems to work
- next test is for trimmomatic, message says, java is missing, install jre
- everything "OK"


**** Is there a way to test the installation?
There are two examples with test data provided. I will follow both

ref-guided:
1. get reads -> success
2. clean reads -> success
3. singlePE: velvet assembly failed
   both PE and MP: velvet assembly failed

de-novo:
1. get reads -> success
2. clean reads -> success
3. assembly -> velvet fails
**** Is there a tutorial on how to use the tool?
there are two howto files, I will test one of them (HOWTO_brachy.txt)

1. downloading reads from sra
2. preparing read file
3. running 0_get_cp_reads.pl
4. cleaning reads
5. create config file (typo in file name)
6. assembling
   Error: apparently, getopts.pl is missing -> installing via apt libperl4-corelibs-perl
   try again assembling
   works
7. assembly without reference: works, too


**** Is there a good documentation on the parameter settings?
short descriptions when calling with ~--help~ option
**** Is the tool maintained (issues answered, implementation of new features)?

*** new version
**** questions
***** Is the tool easy to install?
there are two ways - testing "in situ" first
- git is missing -> installing via apt
- as python is not there, I am using python3
- ~python3 setup.py --in-situ~ fails with missing setuptools
- installing python3-setuptools via apt
- pip is missing in the next step (installation of numpy, scipy and sympy)
- installing python3-pip via apt
- works with pip3

***** Is there a way to test the installation?
no test data provided -> using the chloroextractor set
works.
**** summary
Installation instructions changed 
- still not perfect
- missing things like git and pip
- confusion about python versions

dependencies not found error is fixed as deps are now packaged with GetOrganelle

Tutorial, maintenance and license stay the same

***** Is there a way to test the installation?
using the chloroextractor test data with the example command from the fastplast readme

- looks like java is missing -> installing openjdk-11-jre-headless via apt
- python seems to be missing -> installing via apt

works now.
